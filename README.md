# video-audio-extract-clips
Input a spreadsheet-like tabbed list of video/audio filenames and start+end times and clip names, then get precisely cut clips from those files.

Place source audios/videos in the "in" folder, input the times correctly, run the script, then the outputs will be in the "out" folder.
